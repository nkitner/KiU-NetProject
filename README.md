# KiU-NetProject

This repository reflects our most up-to-date work in reproducing the paper KiU-Net: Overcomplete Convolutional Architectures for Biomedical Image and Volumetric Segmentation.

This is not a finished product, but to run our current model, simply run the file train_model.py. The model will be saved in your local directory when completed.

Alternatively, you can run the following line to execute the script in your command line:
```python
python train_model.py
```
